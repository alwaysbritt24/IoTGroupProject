This project explores the field of cybersecurity, specifically aiming to improve the security of smart home systems by utilizing Raspberry Pi technology. 
Our objective is to enhance the security features of Uncle Roger's garage controller system in order to enable remote access for multiple users, while also 
guaranteeing the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Like the previous labs completed throughout the semester, Uncle Roger's garage system 
acts as the central component of our project, presenting a practical situation where we need to identify and address security vulnerabilities. The existing 
system does not have the ability to securely handle multiple users, which possesses a substantial threat to the privacy of personal data and the reliability 
of the garage access controls. Our objective is to securely register new users into the system by necessitating the submission of important details, including 
usernames, email addresses and passwords. In addition, our objective is to facilitate remote access for these authorized users, enabling them to remotely operate 
the garage door from any location and at any time, while strictly following rigorous security measures. During the project, we will consistently adhere to secure
design principles to guarantee compatibility, usability, confidentiality, and robustness against possible attacks. It is our goal to achieve a smooth and secure 
user experience by effectively integrating the software and hardware components, while also tackling the security challenges inherent in Uncle Roger's garage and 
other smart home systems. To accomplish this, we will utilize software components such as the Firebase Realtime Database for secure storage and real-time communication, 
a Python IDE for coding and testing functionalities, and the Flask Web Application Framework for developing the user interface and backend functionalities. On the hardware 
side, we will employ a Raspberry Pi 4 as the core component, alongside a breadboard for prototyping and connecting electronic components, jumper wires for establishing 
electrical connections, LEDs for visual indicators, resistors for current limitation, a buzzer for audible alerts or notifications and push buttons which will be used as 
physical controls for operating the garage door remotely.
